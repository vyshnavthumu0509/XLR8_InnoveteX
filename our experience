we spent 3 days in doing the axel mechanism with so many difficulties in coding yet we used to know all the components used . 
It is very useful such that we created our own code with out the help of any mentor .
we get used to it .
It is one of the best experiences in our life.
Because we choose axel we could Know a lot of thigs that anyone else that we created our own code to control.
