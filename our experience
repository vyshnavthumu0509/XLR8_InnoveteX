We spent three days working on the axle mechanism, overcoming numerous challenges in coding despite being familiar with all the components involved. The experience was invaluable, as we were able to develop our own code without any assistance from a mentor. Through this process, we became proficient in the mechanism, making it one of the most rewarding experiences of our lives. Choosing to work on the axle mechanism allowed us to gain knowledge and skills beyond what is commonly known, empowering us to create our own code for control with confidence and expertise.
