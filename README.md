# XLR8_InnoveteX
We worke hard with krishna ERC convenor but finally we found that the code given by the XRL8 was not working in an android phone it is only working in **ios devices**. so we worked a whole day to chage the code and finally we succeded in changing the code which can be **used in android phones** 
also changed the settings form **joy stick to arrows**
we can also **adjust speed** in our code.
