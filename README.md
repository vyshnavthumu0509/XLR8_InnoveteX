# XLR8_InnoveteX
We worke hard with krishna ERC convenor but finally we found that the code given by the XRL8 was not working in an android phone it is only working in **ios devices**. 
we were hope less because we dont have any iphones .
then we decided to change the code.
we all our team mates with out the help of mentors created our own code.
also changed the settings form **joy stick to arrows**
we can also **adjust speed** in our code. which it is not efficient in joystick.
